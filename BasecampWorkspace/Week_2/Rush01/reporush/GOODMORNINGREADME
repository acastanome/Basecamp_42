Good morning! So... I got carried away with this.

In the sudoku.c in ex00_acastano there is
put together Olga's main and print with my sudoku and helper functions:
1. to check if certain number can be placed in x,y position, it calls other functions to:
a. check if it is already in that row,
b. check if it is already in that column,
c. check if it is already in that square.

I was testing with Julius's test1 and got pretty close but can't now see where to make
the backtracking step so it will work. Hope this helps and talk to you later!
