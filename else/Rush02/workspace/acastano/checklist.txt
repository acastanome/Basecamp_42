To check:
A- There is at least 1 param
B- valid params
C- Params are not repeated ( ./rush-2 rush00 rush00)
D- Are they in order? ( ./rush-2 rush03 rush00)


Plan:
- ft_valid_input to check A and B
	if not: display "aucune" for B, what about A?
- ft_organize_input to check C and D and make necessary corrections
	makes call to main?
- 

End checking:
- Always end in newline!!
- Norm
- compilation
- Right folders, forbidden functions, names of things
